- **Technologies:** JavaScript, Node.js, EJS, MySQL

### Save the World Game
In fulfillment of Software Engineering Module of MSc, as part of a team of 4, we were tasked with following real world software engineering practices to create a 
virtual board game using Java. Titled â€˜Save the Worldâ€™, this monopoly style game places focus on educating its players about environmental issues while providing engaging gameplay for all 
ages. Up to 4 players move across a virtual game board, purchasing permits for areas and developing them into sources of renewable energy. The goal of the game is to convert 100% of 
the worldâ€™s energy usage into renewable energy with each user aiming to be the player who contributed the most to the overall renewable energy amount.
- **Technologies:** Java (Jira and Gitlab)

### Ausome Family App
For the final individual project of MSc, I am creating an Android application is focused on helping parents of autistic children by providing a tool whereby they can track
their childâ€™s behaviours and achievements alongside a schedule of the childâ€™s day. The child is empowered by having a clear schedule of their dayâ€™s events and a forum to express
their feelings and energy levels against each event. The shared perspective will enable parents to make adjustments where possibily and ease the dynamics of the family as a whole.
In addition, the collated data can be summarised into a report for use by health professionals in the diagnosis process and in the recommendation of supports.
- **Technologies:** Flutter (Dart, Android Studio IDE), Firebase Firestore and Authentication.
